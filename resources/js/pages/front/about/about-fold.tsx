                        appears inclusive on the surface, but acts in exclusive and controlling ways.</p>

                        <p>While the broader LEGO space is known for creativity, collaboration and fun, the F.O.L.D
                            represents a quieter side of things: a group of individuals &ndash; ranging from prominent
                            fans to people with connections inside the company &ndash; that decides who is included,
                            supported, or sidelined.</p>
                        <p>Those who donâ€™t align with their unspoken rules or preferred image often face exclusion,
                            subtle discrimination, or are pushed out entirely.
